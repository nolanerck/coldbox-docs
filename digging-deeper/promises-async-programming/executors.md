# Executors

The ColdBox AsyncManager will allow you to register and manage different types of executors that can execute your very own tasks! Each executor acts as a singleton and can be configured uniquely. \(See: [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html)\)

You can also create executors on the fly so your async futures can use them as well for ONLY that execution stage.

### Executor Types

The types that we currently support are:

* `fixed` : By default it will build one with **20** threads on it. Great for multiple task execution and worker processing.

![Fixed Thread](../../.gitbook/assets/fixedexecutor.png)

* `single` : A great way to control that submitted tasks will execute in the order of submission much like a FIFO queue \(First In First Out\).

![Single Thread](../../.gitbook/assets/singlethreadexecutor.png)

* `cached` : An unbounded pool where the number of threads will grow according to the tasks it needs to service. The threads are killed by a default 60 second timeout if not used and the pool shrinks back to 0.

![Cached Executor](../../.gitbook/assets/cachedexecutor.png)

* `scheduled` : A pool to use for scheduled tasks that can run one time or periodically. The default scheduled task queue has **20** threads for processing.

![Scheduled Executor](../../.gitbook/assets/scheduledexecutor.png)

Please note that each executor is unique in its way of operation, so make sure you read about each type in the JavaDocs or watch this amazing video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIkG0X4fqs4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIkG0X4fqs4)

### Executor Methods

Here are the methods you can use for registering and managing singleton executors in your application:

* `newExecutor()` : Create and register an executor according to passed arguments.  If the executor exists, just return it.
* `newScheduledExecutor()` : Create a scheduled executor according to passed arguments. Shortcut to `newExecutor( type: "scheduled" )`
* `newSingleExecutor()` : Create a single thread executor. Shortcut to `newExecutor( type: "single", threads: 1 )`
* `newCachedExecutor()` : Create a cached thread executor. Shortcut to `newExecutor( type: "cached" )`
* `getExecutor()` : Get a registered executor registerd in this async manager
* `getExecutorNames()` : Get the array of registered executors in the system
* `hasExecutor()` : Verify if an executor exists
* `deleteExecutor()` : Delete an executor from the registry, if the executor has not shutdown, it will shutdown the executor for you using the shutdownNow\(\) event
* `shutdownExecutor()` : Shutdown an executor or force it to shutdown, you can also do this from the Executor themselves. If an un-registered executor name is passed, it will ignore it
* `shutdownAllExecutors()` : Shutdown all registered executors in the system
* `getExecutorStatusMap()` : Returns a structure of status maps for every registered executor in the manager. This is composed of tons of stats about the executor.

And here are the full signatures:

```javascript
/**
 * Creates and registers an Executor according to the passed name, type and options.
 * The allowed types are: fixed, cached, single, scheduled with fixed being the default.
 *
 * You can then use this executor object to submit tasks for execution and if it's a
 * scheduled executor then actually execute scheduled tasks.
 *
 * Types of Executors:
 * - fixed : By default it will build one with 20 threads on it. Great for multiple task execution and worker processing
 * - single : A great way to control that submitted tasks will execute in the order of submission: FIFO
 * - cached : An unbounded pool where the number of threads will grow according to the tasks it needs to service. The threads are killed by a default 60 second timeout if not used and the pool shrinks back
 * - scheduled : A pool to use for scheduled tasks that can run one time or periodically
 *
 * @see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html
 *
 * @name The name of the executor used for registration
 * @type The type of executor to build fixed, cached, single, scheduled
 * @threads How many threads to assign to the thread scheduler, default is 20
 * @debug Add output debugging
 * @loadAppContext Load the CFML App contexts or not, disable if not used
 *
 * @return The ColdBox Schedule class to work with the schedule: coldbox.system.async.tasks.Executor
 */
Executor function newExecutor(
    required name,
    type                   = "fixed",
    numeric threads        = this.$executors.DEFAULT_THREADS,
    boolean debug          = false,
    boolean loadAppContext = true
)

/**

struct function getExecutorStatusMap( name )
```

### Single Use Executors

If you just want to use executors for different completion stages and then discard them, you can easily do so by using the `$executors` public component in the `AsyncManager`. This object can be found at: `coldbox.system.async.util.Executors`:

```javascript
asyncManager.$executors.{creationMethod}()
```

The available creation methods are:

```javascript
this.DEFAULT_THREADS = 20;
/**
 * Creates a thread pool that reuses a fixed number of threads operating off a shared unbounded queue.
 *
 * @see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html
 *
 * @threads The number of threads in the pool, defaults to 20
 *
 * @return ExecutorService: The newly created thread pool
 */
function newFixedThreadPool( numeric threads = this.DEFAULT_THREADS )

/**
 * Creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but will
 * reuse previously constructed threads when they are available.
 *
 * @see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html
 *
 * @return ExecutorService: The newly created thread pool
 */
function newCachedThreadPool()

/**
 * Creates a thread pool that can schedule commands to run after a given delay,
 * or to execute periodically.
 *
 * @see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html
 *
 * @corePoolSize The number of threads to keep in the pool, even if they are idle, default is 20
 *
 * @return ScheduledExecutorService: The newly created thread pool
 */
function newScheduledThreadPool( corePoolSize = this.DEFAULT_THREADS )
```

This way you can use them and discard them upon further processing.

```javascript
// Create an IO bound pool with 100 threads to process my data
var dataQueue = [ data, data ... data1000 ];
var results = asyncManager
    .newFuture( executor : asyncManager.$executors.newFixedThreadPool( 100 ) )
    .allApply( dataQueue, ( item ) => dataService.process( item )  );

// Create two types of thread pools: 1) CPU intesive, 2) IO Intensive
var cpuBound = asyncManager.$executors.newFixedThreadPool( 4 );
var ioBound = asyncManager.$executors.newFixedThreadPool( 50 );

// Process an order with different executor pools
newFuture( () => orderService.getOrder(), ioBound )
    .thenAsync( (order) => enrichOrder( order ), cpuBound )
    .thenAsync( (order) => performPayment( order ), ioBound )
    .thenAsync( (order) => dispatchOrder( order ), cpuBound )
    .thenAsync( (order) => sendConfirmation( order ), ioBound );
```

### ColdBox Task Scheduler

Every ColdBox application will register a task scheduler called `coldbox-tasks` which ColdBox internal services can leverage it for tasks and schedules. It is configured with 20 threads and using the `scheduled` type. You can leverage if you wanted to for your own tasks as well.

```javascript
property name="scheduler" inject="executor:coldbox-tasks";

async().getExecutor( "coldbox-tasks" );
```

### ColdBox Application Executor Registration

We have also added a new configuration struct called `executors` which you can use to register global executors or per-module executors.

```javascript
// In your config/ColdBox.cfc
function configure(){

    executors = {
        "name" : {
            "type" : "fixed",
            "threads" : 100
        }
    };

}
```

Each executor registration is done as a struct with the name of the executor and at most two settings:

* `type` : The executor type you want to register
* `threads` : The number of threads to assign to the executor

#### ModuleConfig.cfc

You can also do the same at a per-module level in your module's `ModuleConfig.cfc`.

```javascript
// In your ModuleConfig.cfc
function configure(){

    executors = {
        "name" : {
            "type" : "fixed",
            "threads" : 100
        }
    };

}
```

ColdBox will register your executors upon startup and un-register and shut them down when the module is unloaded.

### WireBox Injection DSL

We have extended WireBox so you can inject registered executors using the following DSL: `executors:{name}`

```javascript
// Inject an executor called `taskScheduler` the same name as the property
property name="taskScheduler" inject="executor";
// Inject the `coldbox-tasks` as `taskScheduler`
property name="taskScheduler" inject="executor:coldbox-tasks";
```
