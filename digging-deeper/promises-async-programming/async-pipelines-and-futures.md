# Async Pipelines & Futures

## Creation Methods

You will be able to create async pipelines and futures by using the following `AsyncManager` creation methods:

* `newFuture( [task], [executor] ):Future` : Returns a ColdBox Future. You can pass an optional task \(closure/udf\) and even an optional executor.
* `newCompletedFuture( value ):Future` : Returns a new future that is already completed with the given value.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that some of the methods above will return a ColdBox Future object that is backed by Java's `CompletableFuture` \([https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html)\)
{% endhint %}

Here are the method signatures for the methods above:

```javascript
/**
 * Create a new ColdBox future backed by a Java completable future
 *
 * @value The actual closure/lambda/udf to run with or a completed value to seed the future with
 * @executor A custom executor to use with the future, else use the default
 * @debug Add debugging to system out or not, defaults is false
 * @loadAppContext Load the CFML engine context into the async threads or not, default is yes.
 *
 * @return ColdBox Future completed or new
 */
Future function newFuture(
    any value,
    any executor,
    boolean debug          = false,
    boolean loadAppContext = true
)

/**
 * Create a completed ColdBox future backed by a Java Completable Future
 *
 * @value The value to complete the future with
 * @debug Add debugging to system out or not, defaults is false
 * @loadAppContext Load the CFML engine context into the async threads or not, default is yes.
 *
 * @return ColdBox Future completed
 */
Future function newCompletedFuture(
    required any value,
    boolean debug          = false,
    boolean loadAppContext = true
)
```

### Usage

There are two ways to start async computations with futures:

1. Via the `newFuture()` constructor
2. Via the `run()` method

The constructor is the shortcut approach and only allows for closures to be defined as the task. The `run()` methods allows you to pass a CFC instance and a `method` name, which will then call that method as the initial computation.

```javascript
// Constructor
newFuture( () => newUser() )

// Run Operations
newFuture().run( () => newUser() )
newFuture().run( supplier : userService, method : "newUser" )
```

Here are the `run()` method signatures:

```javascript
/**
 * Executes a runnable closure or component method via Java's CompletableFuture and gives you back a ColdBox Future:
 *
 * - This method calls `supplyAsync()` in the Java API
 * - This future is asynchronously completed by a task running in the ForkJoinPool.commonPool() with the value obtained by calling the given Supplier.
 *
 * @supplier A CFC instance or closure or lambda or udf to execute and return the value to be used in the future
 * @method If the supplier is a CFC, then it executes a method on the CFC for you. Defaults to the `run()` method
 * @executor An optional executor to use for asynchronous execution of the task
 *
 * @return The new completion stage (Future)
 */
Future function run(
    required supplier,
    method       = "run",
    any executor = variables.executor
)
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the majority of methods take in an `executor` that you can supply. This means that you can decide in which thread pool the task will execute in, or by default it will run in the `ForkJoinPool` or the same thread the computation started from.
{% endhint %}

## Completed Futures

There are also times where you need a future to be completed immediately. For this you can build a future already completed via the `newCompletedFuture()` or by leveraging the `complete()` function in the Future object.

## Usage Methods

There are many many methods in the Java JDK that are implemented in the ColdBox Futures.  We have also added several new methods that play very nicely with our dynamic language.  Here is a collection of the currently implemented methods.
